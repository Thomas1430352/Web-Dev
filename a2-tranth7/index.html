                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                    <p>The index page is considered where most web server pages are mapped to by default. This means in real-world applications or websites, 
                        most default home pages are index.html files. OSU's apache engineer software server also uses index.html as the default name.
                    </p>
                    <p>When viewing the browser inspector network tab, the individual is able to see file extensions like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                        Then we are also able to see information to monitor the network activity when trying to access the pages. A difference between the two is that the engineer page has more resources, 
                        like content.js, executor.js, and favicon.ico. The browser tab also does not show a clear network response or latency as it is local and not a get request online.
                    </p>
                    <p>The favicon has a 200 code meaning it was successful in finding the resource and displaying it, 
                        while main.js had a 404 code which is the code for not found, or that the main.js resource/file could not be found or displayed. 
                        The network tab also showed a 404 code for main.css.
                    </p>
                    <p>The URL is https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tranth7/a1-tranth7/, where the scheme is HTTPS, an encrypted version of HTTP. 
                        The subdomain is the web and engr, and the host domain is oregonstate.edu. Finally, the resource is /~tranth7/a1-tranth7.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea of front end design should be thought of as designing a user interface with the best experience and usability for the end user.
                        This is to mean that the developer will use a good visual design and a practical design. Where visual could be things like matching font, color scheme, and themes.
                        A practical design can mean making it easy to navigate or intuitive in the buttons and iterfaces so that the application's usability increases.
                        One way a developer can interpret usability of a website or application is by using the five "E"s known as effective, efficient, easy-to-navigate, error-free, and enjoyability.
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Effective</dt>
                        <dd>Determined by how well the application or design helps to accomplish the user's goal's. The design should do what it is intended to do and should display accurate results.</dd>
                        <dt>Efficient</dt>
                        <dd>Determined by if the design uses the least amount of steps to reach end-goal or solution. 
                            The application should have the least amount of unneccesary steps to accomplish task at hand, and the results should be showed promptly.</dd>
                        <dt>Easy-to-Navigate</dt>
                        <dd>Determined by how practical and intuitive the design is. The user should understand how to use the application whether it's their first time or next time using it</dd>
                        <dt>Error-Free</dt>
                        <dd>Determined by how many problems occur for user when using applications. The application should be accessible and availble to the user, 
                            and bugs should not appear when the application is being used for it's intended purpose.</dd>
                        <dt>Enjoyable</dt>
                        <dd>Determined by how much the intended audiance enjoys the product. The application should be engaging to the user and should make the user want to come back to use it. 
                            Enjoyable can be determined by the other four "E"s, and also by design as well.
