                    <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                        <p>The index page is considered where most web server pages are mapped to by default. This means in real-world applications or websites, 
                            most <strong>default home pages are index.html files</strong>. OSU's Apache engineer software server also uses index.html as the default name.
                        </p>
                        <p>When viewing the browser inspector <strong>network tab</strong>, the individual is able to see file extensions like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                            Then we are also able to see information to monitor the network activity when trying to access the pages. A difference between the two is that the engineer page has more resources, 
                            like content.js, executor.js, and favicon.ico. The browser tab also does not show a clear network response or latency as it is local and not a get request online.
                        </p>
                        <p>The favicon has a 200 code meaning it was successful in finding the resource and displaying it, 
                            while main.js had a 404 code which is the code for not found, or that the main.js resource/file could not be found or displayed. 
                            The network tab also showed a 404 code for main.css.
                        </p>
                        <p>The URL is https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tranth7/a1-tranth7/, where the scheme is HTTPS, an encrypted version of HTTP. 
                            The subdomain is the web and engr, and the host domain is oregonstate.edu. Finally, the resource is /~tranth7/a1-tranth7.

                    <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            The idea of front-end design should be thought of as designing a user interface with the best experience and usability for the end user.
                            This is to mean that the developer will use a good visual design and a practical design. Visual could be things like matching font, color scheme, and themes.
                            A practical design can mean making it easy to navigate or intuitive in the buttons and interfaces so that the application's usability increases.
                            One way a developer can interpret the usability of a website or application is by using the five "E"s known as <strong>effective, efficient, easy-to-navigate, error-free, and enjoyable.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Effective</dt>
                            <dd>Determined by how well the application or design helps to accomplish the user's goals. The design should do what it is created to do and should display accurate results.</dd>
                            <dt>Efficient</dt>
                            <dd>Determined by if the design uses the least amount of steps to reach the end goal or solution. 
                                The application should have the least amount of unnecessary steps to accomplish the task at hand, and the results should be shown promptly.</dd>
                            <dt>Easy-to-Navigate</dt>
                            <dd>Determined by how practical and intuitive the design is. The user should understand how to use the application, whether it's their first time or next time using it</dd>
                            <dt>Error-Free</dt>
                            <dd>Determined by how many problems occur for the user when using applications. The application should be accessible and available to the user, 
                                and bugs should not appear when the application is being used for its intended purpose.</dd>
                            <dt>Enjoyable</dt>
                            <dd>Determined by how much the intended audience enjoys the product. The application should be engaging to the user and should make the user want to come back to use it. 
                                Enjoyable can be determined by the other four "E"s, and also by design as well.
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
                        <p> Then there are page layout tags, which are a type of block element in HTML used to break apart web pages or to section off different content. 
                            The layout tags consist of these elements: header, nav, main, section, article, aside, figure, blockquote, footer, and div.
                            The <strong>header</strong> tag is usually the banner or headline of the application, and the same across pages, where it includes things like name, publisher, logo, and slogan.
                            The <strong>nav</strong> element is a way for users to navigate from different pages and can have multiple ways to navigate the application like search bars, menus, locations, or even links.
                            The <strong>main</strong> element is just to section off the primary area where the content will be held, like your articles and sections.
                            The <strong>section</strong> element is used to thematically group articles or contents that relate but aren't the same. Like a math book, has chapters with subchapters.
                            The <strong>article</strong> section is typically going to be placed inside section tags, which are used to identify individual specific topics, and are usually headlined with a "h2".
                            Aside elements usually have correlated information to the article and sit on the side. The <strong> figure and figcaption </strong> element are typically used like the aside element, but have media files
                            along with "figcaption" to accompany the media. The <strong>blockquote</strong> element is for quotations that are too long for a paragraph and are usually visually different from the paragraph.
                            The <strong>footer</strong> is usually below the tag and holds all information related to legal information, and contact information, and can have links to other related content or passages. The footer
                            should also contain the websites owner's copyright statement, year of publication, and the owner's name. The <strong>div</strong> element is used to divide
                            content when it does not seemingly fit in one of the other elements and usually has no style or dimensions.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <p>Anchors are pieces of text that marks the beginning and end of a hypertext link.</p>
                            <li><strong>Anchors</strong> are noted with an "a" tag, and for external links include a URL in the form of "a href-"https/domain.com"", and then a  description to note where the anchor is taking the user</li>
                            <li>An internal anchor is an element that links different parts of the same page where clicking on one jumps to a designated section of the page by using IDs in place of URLs</li>
                            <li>The anchor can also jump from page to page by using the file names or URL in a similar fashion to  jumping to different external sites</li>    
                            <li>An absolute anchor is one that provides a URL that contains more information than a relative URL. A benefit of a relative URL, though, is that it is more portable and convenient due to its shorter length
                                and only shows the path to the file or the file itself, where it transfers a user from point to point within the same domain. While an absolute provides info like domain name and the complete location information of the site.
                            </li>

                <article id="OptimizingImages">
                    <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are six major specifications of images for the web, which are: descriptive file name, small file size, exact dimensions, correct file format, reduced resolution, and color mode.
                            Descriptive file names help with search engine optimization and should be descriptive yet precise to describe an image so that search engines can find it when keywords are used by users.
                            Small file size helps to reduce the time it takes to load images or other files, and can also be used to give correct resolution files to higher-res or lower-res devices. For smaller file 
                            sizes you can use lossy compression where it loses image data to compress a file or lossless where it compresses without lowering the visual quality. Exact dimensions are important as they 
                            allow the image to fit in the browser or web page and can make it load better. The correct file format allows for web pages to load files, whereas JPG is usually for online photos, but there are also
                            WebP, PNG, SVG, and GIF should be used for different file needs. Then there is reduced resolution, where the developer should provide the correct resolution to fit the user's monitors or devices,
                            but today there are multiple resolutions, and providing multiple sizes for files is becoming the standard. Then there are color modes, where RGB is standard for PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP, and Indexed for 
                            GIF. For line art, file formats should usually be PNG, SVG, or GIF file formats, while for photos, file formats should be JPG or WebP.

                <article id="Favicons">
                    <h3>Favicons</h3>
                        <p>
                            Favicons are also known as favorite icons, where devices and browsers use the favicon as a way to identify and/or start-up websites and applications. Favicons are usually in the file formats of GIF,
                            PNG, ICO, and SVG. In today's time, ICO is usually only for legacy browsers, but the more common ones are SVG or PNG files. It is usually a symbol that represents a website, app, or company and can exist
                            as a browser tab icon, a favorite bar icon, or even a mobile app icon. It usually starts off as a symbol and gets modified from resolution to file type to be able to display on different devices and browsers.
