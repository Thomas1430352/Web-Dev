    <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>
    <p>The index page is considered where most web server pages are mapped to by default. This means in real-world applications or websites, 
        most default home pages are index.html files.
    </p>
    <p>When viewing the browser inspector network tab, the individual is able to see file extensions like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        Then we are also able to see information to monitor the network activity when trying to access the pages. A difference between the two is that the engineer page has more resources, like content.js, executor.js, and favicon.ico. The tab drag browser also does not show a clear network response or latency as it is local and not a get request online.
    </p>
    <p>The favicon has a 200 code meaning it was successful in finding the resource and displaying it, 
        while main.js had a 404 code which is the code for not found, or that the main.js resource/file could not be found or displayed.
    </p>
    <p>The URL is https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tranth7/a1-tranth7/, where the scheme is HTTPS, an encrypted version of HTTP. 
        The subdomain is the web, and the host domain is engr.oregonstate.edu. Finally, the resource is /~tranth7/a1-tranth7.
